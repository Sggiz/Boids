# Application of the Boid life algorithm using Unity

The Boid algorithm (bird-oid) tries to simulate the group behaviour of a flock of birds.
A very simple set of rules is given to individuals with limited and localized information.
Despite the simplicity of these rules, a mesmerizing swarm behaviour appears as the number of individuals grows.

Based on the ideas from : https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/labs/s2021/Boids/Boids.html

Using C# with Unity.
